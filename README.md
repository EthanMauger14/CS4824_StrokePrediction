# CS4824_StrokePrediction
Includes the Jupyter Notebook, data file, and Anaconda Navigator installation instructions necessary to completely reproduce my results and method.

# Anaconda Installation Instructions (Modified from the CS3654 Anaconda Installation Instructions)
## 1. Already Installed?
- Check if Anaconda Navigator is already in the Start/Application menu, or installed on your drive. If so, skip to step 3.

## 2. Install
- You can download Anaconda from http://www.anaconda.com/distribution. Download the latest installer most appropriate for your machine (almost certainly 64-bit, so the only choice that you need to worry about is the operating system).
- After the download is complete, run the installer. You should be fine with keeping all of the default options.
- If you get to the end of these instructions and aren't able to run Jupyter, uninstall Anaconda, reboot, and then select the "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" option when you are reinstalling. This is the one place where you might need to change the default option. 
- The installation process can take a while. Click the Details button to be sure that things are still happening and that the installer hasn't frozen or encountered another error.

## 3. Run Anaconda Navigator
- Find it in the Start/Application menu, or where ever you installed it. It displays a menu of several data science tools, including Jupyter Notebook.

## 4. Update
- If Anaconda Navigator has an update available, go for it. There would be an update notice in the upper right corner of the window.
- If Jupter Notebook has an update available, go for it. In the menu square for Jupyter Notebook, click the gear in the upper right corner, and Update Application.

## 5. Restart Navigator and Run Jupyter
- By clicking the Jupyter Notebook Launch button in the Anaconda Navigator.
- This should open a browser window that is running the Jupyter Notebook app. It starts with a Files tab, which enables you to navigate your drive and open or create Jupyter Notebook .ipynb files.

## 6. Upload Notebook and healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv Files Provided
- Click on the upload button in the top right or drag and drop the files in this repository into the same directoy in Jupyter Notebooks. You can now open the .ipynb file and reproduce the methods described.
